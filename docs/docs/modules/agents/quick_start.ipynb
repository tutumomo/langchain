    "To best understand the agent framework, let's build an agent that has two tools: one to look things up online, and one to look up specific data that we've loaded into a index.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will assume knowledge of [LLMs](/docs/modules/model_io/) and [retrieval](/docs/modules/data_connection/) so if you haven't already explored those sections, it is recommended you do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup: LangSmith\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, agents take a self-determined, input-dependent sequence of steps before returning a user-facing output. This makes debugging these systems particularly tricky, and observability particularly important. [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith) is especially useful for such cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "When building with LangChain, all steps will automatically be traced in LangSmith.\n",
    "To set up LangSmith we just need set the following environment variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=\"true\"\n",
    "export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=\"<your-api-key>\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Define tools\n",
    "\n",
    "We first need to create the tools we want to use. We will use two tools: [Tavily](/docs/integrations/tools/tavily_search) (to search online) and then a retriever over a local index we will create"

    "Note that this requires an API key - they have a free tier, but if you don't have one or don't want to create one, you can always ignore this step.\n",
